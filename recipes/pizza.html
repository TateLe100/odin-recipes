    </ul>

    <h5>Instructions:</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the Dough:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water. Let it sit for
          about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large mixing bowl, combine 3 ½ cups of flour, olive oil, sugar,
          and salt. Add the yeast mixture and stir until a dough forms.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 5-7
          minutes, adding more flour if needed, until the dough is smooth and
          elastic.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen
          towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it
          has doubled in size.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Prepare the Sauce:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          While the dough is rising, combine the tomato sauce, oregano, basil,
          garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper in a small saucepan.
          Simmer on low heat for about 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to
          meld together. Remove from heat and set aside.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Assemble the Pizza:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place
          it in the oven to preheat as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into two equal
          portions (for two medium pizzas) or keep it whole for one large pizza.
        </li>
        <li>
          Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.
          Transfer the dough to a pizza peel or a baking sheet lined with
          parchment paper if you don’t have a pizza stone.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spread a layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border
          around the edges. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over
          the sauce.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Bake the Pizza:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated
          stone. If not, place the baking sheet directly in the oven.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the
          cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Serve:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Remove the pizza from the oven. If desired, sprinkle with grated
          Parmesan cheese and fresh basil leaves.
        </li>
        <li>Slice and serve hot!</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
